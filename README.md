This project is called the Stock Tracker App. The program allows users to manage and record their stock trades so they can review and keep track of their trading activity over time. Users can enter details for both buy and sell trades, including the number of shares, price, risk level, commissions, and profits. The application then organizes this information and displays summaries to help users understand the value and performance of their trades.
